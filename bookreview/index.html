<p>It&amp;apos;s more of a 3.75 star.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I found the plot to be very promising and had gripping subplots too which was capable of making it a great book and not just a one time read (at-least for me).

<p>It&amp;apos;s a 4.5 stars for me.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The story is intriguing and will grab your attention from the first chapter itself.

<p>5 BIG Stars!! Loveeeeeed this book. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Starting of this book felt like continuing from the first book itself, the same fast paced thrill like the first book was.

<br>
Rating: 4 ⭐ <br>
<p>A story that makes you keep turning pages. Its Unputdownable.&lt;br/>And the best thing about it is that its so realistic than you feel like you yourself are in Beartown amidst everything that is going on. You feel like a part of it all.</p>
